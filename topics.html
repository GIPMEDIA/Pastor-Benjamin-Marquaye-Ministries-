    There are many people around you who are agent of the Devil ( the enemy of your soul ). 
    The sad issue is that they themselves don’t know the devil is using them to get to you. 
    Let look at Peter from Matthew 16:21-23. Peter was being used by the devil but was unaware. 
    What would have happened if Jesus should have listened to Peter and not go to Jerusalem, 
    you and I would have lost the opportunity to be saved by the death of Jesus. 
    The devil will never stop making attempts to destroy you just because you passed the test in the dessert. 
    Satan will use the people surrounding you to gain your heart and attention. 
    This is the reason why you need to gain access to God yourself and stop putting your hope and trust in man just because he or she bears the title Apostle,
     Prophet or Archbishop etc.
     Many have listened to advice from their best friend or person they really trusted and revered so much and 
     have wasted or diverted from their destiny.
      How painful it is not to accomplish your destiny, the very purpose you were brought to this earth. 
      My question is what account would you make to God on your day of departure? 
    Will it be an account of your personal life or an account of someone else you have falsely lived on this earth.
  Please YOU reading be advised that the enemy of your soul is standing right behind you desiring 
  earnestly to send you to HELL. Therefore run your life with no other person than God 
  for you can’t blame anyone if you miss HEAVEN not even your PASTOR. 
  Bless someone by sharing it to them God bless you.
